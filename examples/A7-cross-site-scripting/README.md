# A7 - Cross-Site Scripting
XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victimâ€™s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.

# Example
This dummy example with [reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/) displays user profile information:
```clojure
(defn show-user-profile [id]
  (fn []
    (let [{:keys [username linkedin]} (get-user! id)]
      [:div
       [:p [:strong "Username: "] username]
       [:p [:strong "LinkedIn: "]
        [:a {:href linkedin} "LinkedIn Profile"]]])))
 ```
Although the HTML tag content is escaped by reagent, the href attribute is not. In this scenario an attacker could provide a javascript payload instead of the LinkedIn profile URL, that will be executed when the link is clicked.

```javascript
javascript: alert(1);window.location.replace(\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/hacker\");
```
This kind of attack occurs only on the victims browser.

# Fix
Always sanitize the user input before sending it back to the browser.
